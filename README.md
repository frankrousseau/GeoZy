[Cozy](http://cozy.io) is a platform that brings all your web services in the
same private space.  With it, your web apps and your devices can share data
easily, providing you with a new experience. You can install Cozy on your own
hardware where no one profiles you.

## ToDo and Tool

Inspired from [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/)
*"GeoJSON is a format for encoding a variety of geographic data structures"*
